# Personal Expense Tracker (Python)

## Overview
A simple command-line Personal Expense Tracker to record and summarize daily expenses.
Data is stored in a CSV file (`expenses.csv`) so it's easy to view, edit, and import.

## Files
- `expense_tracker.py` — main program (CLI)
- `expenses.csv` — data file (created automatically)
- `sample_expenses.csv` — sample data you can copy to `expenses.csv`
- `README.md` — this file
- `project_summary.txt` — short summary for submission

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Download the project files to a folder.
3. (Optional) Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x expense_tracker.py
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 expense_tracker.py
   ```
5. Use the menu to add/view expenses and view summaries.

## Notes
- The CSV file `expenses.csv` will be created automatically in the same folder.
- You can open `expenses.csv` in Excel or a text editor to inspect or edit entries.
